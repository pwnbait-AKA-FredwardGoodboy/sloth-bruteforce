This is a python script that will generate possible password combinations of up to 8 characters. It will take many thousands of years to complete on a standard home computer.

Using the string ``abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890-=!@#$%^&*()_+`~`` this script uses nested loops to display and write to a plaintext file named `pwdlist.txt` every possible password combination in order.

Fear not! After it is done, the script will close itself, freeing up valuable processing power for the robot overlords that shall rule the barren waste of a planet after our demise.

This script is fully open source and distributed under the Unilicense.
If you successfully complete the operation of it, feel free to shoot me a message.
